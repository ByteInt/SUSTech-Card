# SUSTech-Card
A preservation of SUSTech Card.

SUSTech Card is used by everyone at SUSTech. We'd like to draw the face of SUSTech Card so that it can be displayed once these cards are disused.

The pictures are saved as PSD files. You can open and edit the layers with Adobe Photoshop or view with other softwares.

The pictures are 55x85 cm size, so it can be zoomed to 10x size without much distortion.

Notice: The picture is for viewing only, and can not be used to make fake cards!
